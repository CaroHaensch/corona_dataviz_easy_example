# corona_dataviz_easy_example
A gentle intro to data with with ggplot2 and data on the Corona Virus for my undergrads (very little experience with R)

I use the data from https://coronatracker.org/ and https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 (Thanks!) and create a little line plot.

Uses readr to import the data, tidyr to transform it to long format, lubridate for the date variable and a simple ggplot for data viz.
I plan it for the third week of R and the tidyverse with my students (should take 30-45 min).

Atm in German (sorry) will probably add an English version this evening.
